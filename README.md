# hangman
My solution to the Hangman project for The Odin Project

## Focus areas in this project
The new topic for this project was serialization and how to save objects in Ruby.

## What I learned
I implemented my solution using JSON, as I expect JSON will be more widely used in the world of web development. To save the hangman game, I only included the necessary instance variables from the Game and Player classes in the save file. These objects were then reinstated if the player chose to load the game.

## What could be improved
I feel like I still have a lot of room for improvement in terms of using OOP. It was really interesting to first implement the game without the save/load functionality. I felt pretty good about my solution and breaking things up into classes in that first iteration. Things got pretty complicated when implementing the save/load methods, however, and that lead to my code getting pretty bogged down.
